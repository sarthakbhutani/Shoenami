# Shoe√±ami

## Introduction
This is a hardware based project which intends to offer security features in a shoe.

## Description
The core features of this hardware hack are as follows:
### 1) Have a push button which an individual can press when in distress, then when the circuit completes, through IFTTT API, your location is sent to the 5 dear contacts, so that they can know, one is in trouble & necessary action can be taken
### 2) Have a obstruction detection rigth in your shoe, which will start vibratng when it comes near to an obstruction, our use case resonates with a blind person, who now can have a better understanding regarding the obstructions w/o the stick, and, he can take necessary actions by pivoting from that place to reach his final destination.
